    "Today we want to look at ways to help businesses make the most out of their customers' feedback, which oftentimes comes as textual reviews or comments. To analyze this form of data we can use _sentiment analysis_. It's main goal is to categorize attitudes towards something. This is quite relevant today, Amazon for example, sells products of all kinds; those who purchase these items are able to leave reviews and comments. Besides the ratings that are given (which are often noisy, can easily be created by bots, or are systematically biased), how would a company be able to tell which products are well-liked and which ones should be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way is through _sentiment analysis_, where the goal is to predict the sentiment or positivity/negativity of a product or service solely based on the text provided as comments and reviews. In this lab, we will explore two different ways to predict and understand the sentiment of text data. First, we will work through a simple **rule-based algorithm**, looking at positive and negative words to determine the classification of reviews. Following this, we will work through a more sophisticated **machine learning-based approach**, allowing us to _learn_ which words are more commonly found in positive versus negative reviews."
