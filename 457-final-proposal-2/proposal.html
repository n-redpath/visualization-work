<h5>Background and Motivation</h5>
<p>Oftentimes, climate change data is simply informational rather than actionable, thus we wanted to put a more applicable 
    spin on presenting this data that will encourage and inform viewers on how to take action. As soon-to-be college graduates, 
    geographical location is hot on our minds and there are tradeoffs to anywhere you choose to live. This map is a tool for people 
    who are moving and want to know how prone their new location is to natural disasters. We also want to acknowledge the fact that 
    certain geographical regions are neglected in terms of infrastructure and struggle to rebuild after a disaster, which is another factor to think about. 
    We want to display the increasing number of natural disasters as a result of climate change, 
    and acknowledge the impact that they have had on communities all over the country.
</p>   



<h5>Project Objectives</h5>
<p>The primary question we are trying to answer with this visualization is whether or 
    not an area is safe to live in, in terms of the frequency of natural disasters. 
    Many areas have become hot spots for fires, tornados, hurricanes and floods. Some 
    people moving to these locations may be unaware of these environmental factors, and 
    invest in high risk properties, or move their families to unsafe locations. We want 
    to create a tool that allows people to see the climate risks of towns and counties so 
    that they can be better informed on what houses to rent or buy.

<h5>Data</h5>
<p>Derived from FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)
</p>

<h5>Data Processing</h5>
<p>Quantities deriving from dataset:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>    femaDeclarationString: Agency standard method for uniquely identifying Stafford Act declarations - Concatenation of declaration type, disaster number and state code. Ex: DR-4393-NC
    </li>
    <li>
        state: The name or phrase describing the U.S. state, district, or territory
    </li>
    <li>
        incidentType: Type of incident such as fire or flood.
    </li>
    <li>
        declarationTitle: Title for the disaster
    </li>
    <li>
        hmProgramDeclared: Denotes whether the Hazard Mitigation program was declared for this disaster. For more information on the program, please visit https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation/hazard-mitigation
    </li>
    <li>
        incidentBeginDate: Date the incident itself began 
    </li>
    <li>
        incidentEndDate: Date the incident itself ended
    </li>
    <li>
        fipsCountyCode: FIPS three-digit numeric code used to identify counties and county equivalents in the United States, the District of Columbia, US territories, outlying areas of the US and freely associated states
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Visualization Design</h5>
<p>The first three sketches are our individual visions of what our page should look like, while the last mockup (made with figma) is the combined design that we have agreed on.</p>
