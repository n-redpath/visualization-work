to do next: 


for this assignment I used two web pages to learn the material. The first was to help me with adding event listeners using d3. This information was taken from the site:  https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/vanilla-javascript-event-listener-on-multiple-elements/ . 

I used the second site to learn how to add a transition for the extra credit portion. This code was learned from the site: https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/interactivity_transition.html
