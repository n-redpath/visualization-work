Nina Redpath assignment 1a 
Due 9/13/21

For this assignment I used two resources. I learned from chapter 3, Technology Fundamentals from Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, 2nd Edition by Scott Murray. This chapter taught me how to make circles, frames, rectangles, lines and paths that I used to make my graphs. It also taught me how to format graphs using strokes and fills and gave me a basic understanding of the SVG axes. 

The second resource I used was this web page: https://css-tricks.com/how-to-make-charts-with-svg/ 
This web page gave me a better understanding of the axes that SVG uses and the transform property, which allowed me to make my graphs more accurate.
